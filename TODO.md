# To-Do

1. run a LUA linter
2. vim-rails? gf?
3. ruby-lsp does not seem to map properly
    1. could try installing vscode and see if it behaves the same way
    2. could try soloargraph
    3. could try using the ruby-lsp gem in a repo just like the video and see if i jump to the same place -> https://shopify.github.io/ruby-lsp/RubyLsp/Requests/Definition.html
    4. getting an error from the ruby-lsp about not finding the Gemfile.lock ~/.local/state/nvim/lsp.log
    5. also getting this: Client 3 quit with exit code 78 and signal 0
    6. try Mason 
4. telescope
    1. look in .bundle, not in .git, tmp, log
    2. search in subdirectory?
    3. switch to ,, and ,.
5. gitsigns
6. nvim-tree
    1. can't seem to open in last focused window
    2. lazy load when .git exists
    3. close when buffer closes
7. autosave
    1. only autosave if .git exists
