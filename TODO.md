# To-Do

1. run a LUA linter
2. vim-rails? gf?
3. ruby-lsp does not seem to map properly
    1. could try installing vscode and see if it behaves the same way
 - could try soloargraph
 - could try using the ruby-lsp gem in a repo just like the video and see if i jump to the same place -> https://shopify.github.io/ruby-lsp/RubyLsp/Requests/Definition.html
 - getting an error from the ruby-lsp about not finding the Gemfile.lock ~/.local/state/nvim/lsp.log
 - also getting this: Client 3 quit with exit code 78 and signal 0
4. telescope
 - look in .bundle, not in .git, tmp, log
 - search in subdirectory?
 - switch to ,, and ,.
5. gitsigns
6. nvim-tree
 - can't seem to open in last focused window
 - lazy load when .git exists
 - close when buffer closes
7. autosave
 - only autosave if .git exists

Check for plugin issues:
```
:checkhealth
```
