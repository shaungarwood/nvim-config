# To-Do

1. add endwise style thing
3. vim-rails? gf?
4. ruby-lsp does not seem to map properly
5. telescope
 - look in .bundle, not in .git, tmp, log
 - search in subdirectory?
10. gitsigns
11. nvim-tree
 - persist across tabs
 - can't seem to open in last focused window
 - lazy load when .git exists
12. autosave
 - only autosave if .git exists

Add video of how it all works
